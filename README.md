# Gym
This project is going to be elaborated with the use of C++ and it is focused in Object-Oriented, using this we will be able to simulate the network of a local GYM where we will have the opportunity per user to find out the workouts available, the exercises, the coach that will be leading him or she and the progress this user will be achieving with the pass of time. We can make this program with the creation of 5 classes, we will have the class of the user, workout, the exercise, the progress and the coach; In order for this class to work, they will be added to a main file so the data can be given for every parameter shown.
# Why
I decided to do this program, because I really enjoy going to the gym and I have noticed that some people suffer from not having a workout in mind or which exercises they must do in order to progress, so making a programm that can provide this information to the user would make the difference for most people.
# How?
I will be able to make this work with the use and creation of various classes, basic functions, pointers, polimorphysm, and more. Making use of the classes will allow to have a proper organization of the basic and most important information that will be shown.
# Classes
# Workout
The workout class will innherit from the exercise class in order to select one exercise of each class (Legs, Push, Pull) and to be able to build a workout for the User.
# Exercise
The exercise class wil recieve the data from Legs, Push, and Pull classes.
# Legs
The legs class will have 6 different types of exercises which will be able to be selected.
# Push
The push class will have 6 different exercises, 3 exercises of chest and 3 exercises of triceps.
# Pull
The pull class will have 6 different exercises, 3 exercises for back and 3 exercises for biceps.
