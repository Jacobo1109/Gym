# Gym
This project is going to be elaborated with the use of C++ and it is focused in Object-Oriented, using this we will be able to simulate the network of a local GYM where we will have the opportunity per user to find out the workouts available, the exercises, the coach that will be leading him or she and the progress this user will be achieving with the pass of time. We can make this program with the creation of 5 classes, we will have the class of the user, workout, the exercise, the progress and the coach; In order for this class to work, they will be added to a main file so the data can be given for every parameter shown.
# Why
I decided to do this program, because I really enjoy going to the gym and I have noticed that some people suffer from not having a workout in mind or which exercises they must do in order to progress, so making a programm that can provide this information to the user would make the difference for most people.
# How?
I will be able to make this work with the use and creation of various classes, basic functions, and more. Making use of the classes will allow to have a proper organization of the basic and most important information that will be shown.
# Classes
# User
The class user will show recieve the data of the person that will be assisting the gym. We will recieve the name, the age, weight, height, and objective.
# Workout
The workout class will show the days the user has been working and the exercises per day it has been doing.
# Exercise
The exercise class wil show the name of the exercise made, the weight that was lifted, sets made, and the muscle worked.
# Progress
The progress class will provide the date since the person started, an average of the weight lifted, the repetitions made in total and the observations.
# Coach
The coach class will be able to provide a workout and he or she will be able to make a change to plans.
# Main
The main is the part were everything will come together and the classes wwill be getting used.
